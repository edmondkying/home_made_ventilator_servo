# home_made_ventilator_servo
Home made ventilator, servo arm presses MPR bag
Home made ventilator made with off the shelf parts for less than $50 with no 3D printed parts whatsoever. Just these parts and 5 minutes.


This is a home made ventilator. It is very crude but it works okay on a test dummy and a lung tester.  The servo arm presses down on
the MPR bag and releases.  Similar to if you're pressing the MPR bag by hand.


Please understand that this is not made for professional use. It is a desperate measure for desperate time. Sometimes having one is better than NOTHING at all. Please do not blame me for anything, just trying to do what I can. With 5 seconds for inhale interval will
yield about 12 breaths per minute.  You get about 500ml of air which is average size breath. So just adjust the time for more or less air. You can use a lung tester to test amount of air and pressure.
